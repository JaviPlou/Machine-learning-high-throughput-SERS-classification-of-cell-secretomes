SVM model to determine cell viability from SERS spectra

The nature of the stress and the resulting intracellular responses are key determinants of the secretome composition, but monitoring such processes remains technically arduous. 

We have previously demonstrated that the relative concentrations of relevant metabolites can be traced by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), thereby allowing label-free biofluid interrogation. We have implemented machine learning methods to identify cell secretome variations while extracting standard features for cell death classification. The developed strategy may pave the way towards a faster implementation of SERS into cell secretome classification, which could be extended even to laboratories lacking highly specialized facilities
